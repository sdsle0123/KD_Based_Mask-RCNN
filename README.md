# Knowledge Distillation-Based Lightweight Mask RCNN
This is a lightweight version of Mask R-CNN on Python 3, Keras, and TensorFlow. It utilizes a lightweight Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) with a ResNet18 backbone. To boost the lightweight model's performance, Knowledge Distillation (KD) is applied.
